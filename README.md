# HUMMUS
McGill Physics Hackathon 2023

Inspiration:
We think that classical physics is beautiful and as exciting as "modern stuff". Simple problems like plucking can create a beautiful complex that intersects with heavy concepts like Fourier analysis and wave decomposition.

What it does:
We have modelled the vibration created by plucking a string at an arbitrary point along it. We can also decipher the rich and complex sound produced by it.

How we built it:
We implemented Fourier equations into our Python code and modelled the sound and the visual behaviour of a wire under stress.

Challenges we ran into:
Time was definitely a critical factor. Finishing everything in time was our biggest challenge. Nevertheless, we came through with a solid project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Considering our level of physics and lack of knowledge in both coding and Fourier Analysis. We are all proud of each other for being able to make this project come to fruition. Go team HUMMUS!

What we learned:
We have learned a lot about coding and how to work as a team. Our passion for learning makes up for our lack of knowledge about coding! We have also developed our social muscle by working with other teams and trying to understand their project.

What's next for Harmonic Undriven Motion Modelling Utility Software (HUMMUS):
More coding and research on physics! The next step is our education will be university and possibly running competitions like this.
